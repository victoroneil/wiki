The Whitecat ESP32 N1 board integrates an ESP32 MCU and a LoRa WAN transceiver. This board is a good start point for deploy real IOT used-cases, in both outdoor and indoor environments, since all the elements that can compromise the power consumption, and that are not used when the board is deployed have not been incorporated (battery charger, usb adapters, etc ...).

**Features:**
* Dual-core Tensilica LX6 microprocessor
* Up to 240MHz clock frequency
* 520kB internal SRAM
* Integrated LoRa WAN transceiver, with onboard antenna, and UFL connector for external antenna.
* Integrated 802.11 BGN WiFi transceiver, with onboard antenna, and UFL connector for external antenna.
* Integrated dual-mode Bluetooth (classic and BLE)
* 5.5 to 3.3V operating range through input voltage regulator
* Second voltage regulator for power on / power off sensors through a dedicated GPIO
* RTC clock
* 2MB Flash memory
