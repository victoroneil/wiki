When Lua RTOS launches the Lua interpreter, and before the Lua prompt appears, 2 scripts are automatically executed. These scripts must be in the root directory:

1. system.lua

   This script is intended for setup the system, for example enable Lua RTOS configurations disabled by default, change default configurations values, setup a network connection, etc. The system.lua script is optional, nothing happens if it's not present in the root directory.

   ```lua
   os.loglevel(os.LOG_INFO)   -- Set the syslog level
   os.logcons(true)           -- Show the messages generated by the syslog in the console
   os.shell(true)             -- Enable the shell
   ```
1. autorun.lua

   This script is intended for setup and launch your application, and it's executed after the system.lua completion.
