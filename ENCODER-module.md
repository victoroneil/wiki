# About this

This module contains functions for work with digital relative rotary encoders.

# Key concepts

A digital relative rotary encoder, is an electro-mechanical device that converts the angular position or motion of a shaft or axle to a digital signal. The output provides information about the motion of the shaft, which is typically further processed elsewhere into information such as speed, distance and position.

Encoders are used in many applications that require precise shaft unlimited rotation, including industrial controls, robotics, special purpose photographic lenses,computer input devices (such as optomechanical mice and trackballs), controlled stress rheometers, and rotating radar platforms.

Digital relative rotary encoders employ two outputs called A & B, which are called quadrature outputs, as they are 90 degrees out of phase.
