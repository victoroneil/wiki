# About this

This module contains functions to control RC servo motors.

# Key concepts

A servo is a rotary actuator, and typically consists of a small electric motor, driving a train of reduction gears, controlled by a control circuit. Historically servos have ben used for radio control and small-scale robotics. 

Radio control servos are connected through a standard three-wire connection:

* power: typically the red wire, that must be connected to a +5V power supply.
* ground: typically the black or brown wire, that must be connected to the board's and power's supply ground.
* signal: typically the yellow, orange or white wire, that must be connected to a board's GPIO.

Never connect the power wire to a GPIO, or your board will be permanently damage.

To use a servo in your program you must do the following:

1. Attach the servo using the servo.attach(..) function. This returns a servo instance that you must store into a variable.

   ```lua
   -- Attach the servo to GPIO26
   s = servo.attach(pio.GPIO26)
   ```

2. Write values to the servo to move it, using the instance's write function.

   ```lua
   -- Move the servo to the 45ยบ position
   s:write(25)
   ```

3. Detach the stepper instance when it is no longer necessary:

   ```lua
   -- Detach the servo
   s:detach()
   ```

# Configuration funcions

## instance = servo.attach(pin)

Create a new servo instance.

Arguments:

* pin: GPIO to use for the servo signal. Use defined constants in the PIO module for this, for example pio.GPIO126.

Returns: a servo instance, or an exception. You must store this instance into a variable for further operations with it.

```lua
-- Attach the servo to GPIO26
s = servo.attach(pio.GPIO26)
```

## instance:detach()

Detach the servo and free all resources used by the servo.

Arguments: none.

Returns: nothing, or an exception.

```lua
-- Detach the servo
s:detach()
```

# Operation functions

## instance:write(angle)

Write an angle value to a servo instance, moving the servo by the specified angle.

Arguments:

* angle: the angle, expressed in degrees to move the servo.

Returns: nothing, or an exception.

```lua
-- Attach the servo to GPIO26
s = servo.attach(pio.GPIO26)

-- Move the servo to the 45ยบ position
s:write(45)
```
