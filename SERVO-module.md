# About this

This module contains functions to control RC servo motors.

# Key concepts

A servo is a rotary actuator, and typically consists of a small electric motor, driving a train of reduction gears, controlled by a control circuit. Historically servos have ben used for radio control and small-scale robotics. 

Radio control servos are connected through a standard three-wire connection:

* power, typically the red wire, and connected to +5V power supply.
* ground, typically the black or brown wire, and connected to the board and power supply ground.
* signal, typically the yellow, orange or white wire, an connected to a board's GPIO.
