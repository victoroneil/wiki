Whitecat is an ecosystem that is being developed by a team of engineers, educators and living lab designers, designed for build Internet Of Things networks in an easy way, covering all the aspects for deploy this kind of networks: hardware and software solutions for the node, the gateway, and the cloud. The fact that the Whitecat team covers multiple fields and disciplines allows us to solve issues in a very dynamic and agile way.

The Whitecat ecosystem itâ€™s a new manner for making Internet Of Things:

* All is Open Hardware, and Open Software.
* Different kind of hardware planforms can coexists, but all of them are programmed with the same programming language and in the same environment.
* Designers can select the right platform for each use without the need of learning a new platform.
* The final product is made from prototypes, and at the final step, the differences between the final product and its prototypes are only in their form factor, for example a PCB board that integrates all the hardware components and a beautiful box for it.
